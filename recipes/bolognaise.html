    <li>
        1 onion diced</li>
     <li>3 celery sticks small diced</li>
     <li>2 carrot sticks peeled and small diced</li>
     <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
     <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
     <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
     <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
     <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
     <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
     <li>1 bay leaf</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
     <li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
     <li>16 ounces Tagliatelle pasta or any pasta of choice</li>
     <li>Chopped parsley for serving</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
           Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, carrots and garlic, and sauté for a few minutes until the vegetables soften.
        </li>
        <li>Add the beef and season with salt and pepper. Break up the ground beef and cook until it’s browned and crumbled. stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and allow it to simmer until it has mostly evaporated, stirring occasionally, in order to help tenderize the beef, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf, oregano and nutmeg. Mix to combine, bring mixture to a boil and then simmer on low uncovered for at least 30 minutes, but preferably 1-2 hours. Simmering for longer will enhance the flavor. Remove from heat and discard the bay leaf.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta and add to individual bowls. Spoon the Bolognese sauce over it. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
